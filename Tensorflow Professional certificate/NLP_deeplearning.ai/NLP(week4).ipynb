journey taken\n","Oh please neer forget me though waves now lie oer me\n","I was once young and pretty and my spirit ran free\n","But destiny tore me from country and loved ones\n","And from the new land I was never to see.\n","A poor emigrants daughter too frightened to know\n","I was leaving forever the land of my soul\n","Amid struggle and fear my parents did pray\n","To place courage to leave oer the longing to stay.\n","They spoke of a new land far away cross the sea\n","And of peace and good fortune for my brothers and me\n","So we parted from townland with much weeping and pain\n","Kissed the loved ones and the friends we would neer see again.\n","The vessel was crowded with disquieted folk\n","The escape from past hardship sustaining their hope\n","But as the last glimpse of Ireland faded into the mist\n","Each one fought back tears and felt strangely alone.\n","The seas roared in anger, making desperate our plight\n","And a fever came oer me that worsened next night\n","Then delirium possessed me and clouded my mind\n","And I for a moment saw that land left behind.\n","I could hear in the distance my dear mothers wailing\n","And the prayers of three brothers that Id see no more\n","And I felt fathers tears as he begged for forgiveness\n","For seeking a new life on the still distant shore.\n","Over in Killarney\n","Many years ago,\n","Me Mither sang a song to me\n","In tones so sweet and low.\n","Just a simple little ditty,\n","In her good ould Irish way,\n","And ld give the world if she could sing\n","That song to me this

to her house in the middle of the night\n","When the moon was shining clearly\n","Shc opened the door and she let me in\n","And divil the one did hear us.\n","She took me horse by the bridle and the bit\n","And she led him to the stable\n","Saying Theres plenty of oats for a soldiers horse,\n","To eat it if hes able.\n","Then she took me by the lily-white hand\n","And she led me to the table\n","Saying: Theres plenty of wine for a soldier boy,\n","To drink it if youre able.\n","Then I got up and made the bed\n","And I made it nice and aisy\n","Then I got up and laid her down\n","Saying: Lassie, are you able?\n","And there we lay till the break of day\n","And divil a one did hear us\n","Then I arose and put on me clothes\n","Saying: Lassie, I must leave you.\n","And when will you return again\n","And when will we get married\n","When broken shells make Christmas bells\n","We might well get married\n","In 1803 we sailed out to sea\n","Out from the sweet town of Derry\n","For Australia bound if we didnt all drown\n","And the marks of our fetters we carried.\n","In the rusty iron chains we sighed for our wains\n","As our good wives we left in sorrow.\n","As the mainsails unfurled our curses we hurled\n","On the English and thoughts of tomorrow.\n","Oh Oh Oh Oh I wish I was back home in Derry.\n","I cursed them to hell as our bow fought the swell.\n","Our ship danced like a moth in the firelights.\n","White horses rode high as the devil passed by\n","Taking souls to Hades by twilight.\n","Five weeks out to sea we were now forty-three\n","Our comrades we buried each morning.\n","In our own slime we were lost in a time.\n","Endless night without dawning.\n","Van Diemans land is a hell for a man\n","To live out his life in slavery.\n","When the climate is raw and the gun makes the law.\n","Neither wind nor rain cares for bravery.\n","Twenty years have gone by and Ive ended me bond\n","And comrades ghosts are behind me.\n","A rebel I came and III die the same.\n","On the cold winds of night you will find me\n","On the banks of the roses, my love and I sat down\n","And I took out my violin to play my love a tune\n","In the middle of the tune, O she sighed and she said\n","O Johnny, lovely Johnny, Would you leave me\n","O when I was a young man, I heard my father say\n","That hed rather see me dead and buried in the clay\n","Sooner than be married to any runaway\n","By the lovely sweet banks of the roses\n","O then I am no runaway and soon Ill let them know\n","I can take a good glass or leave it alone\n","And the man that

taxes went unpaid, I could not them redeem\n","And thats the cruel reason why I left old Skibbereen.\n","Oh well do I remember that bleak December day\n","The landlord and the sheriff came to take us all away\n","They set my roof on fire with their cursed English spleen\n","I heaved a sigh and bade goodbye to dear old Skibbereen.\n","Your mother too, God rest her soul, fell on the stony

by\n","My mind being bent on rambling to Ireland I did fly\n","I stepped on board a vision and I followed with the wind\n","And I shortly came to anchor at the cross of Spancil Hill\n","It being the 23rd June the day before the fair\n","When lrelands sons and daughters in crowds assembled there\n","The young and the old, the brave and the bold their journey to fulfill\n","There were jovial conversations at the fair of Spancil Hill\n","I went to see my neighbors to hear what they might say\n","The old ones were all dead and gone and the young ones turning grey\n","I met with the tailor Quigley, hes a bould as ever still\n","Sure he used to make my britches when I lived in Spancil Hill\n","I paid a flying visit to my first and only love\n","Shes as white as any lily and as gentle as a dove\n","She threw her arms around me saying Johnny I love you still\n","Oh shes Ned the farmers daughter and the flower of Spancil HiII\n","I dreamt I held and kissed her as in the days of yore\n","She said, Johnny youre only joking like manys the time before\n","The cock he crew in the morning he crew both loud and shrill\n","And I awoke in California, many miles from Spancil Hill.\n","Near Banbridge town, in the County Down\n","One morning in July\n","Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen\n","And she smiled as she passed me by.\n","She looked so sweet from her two white feet\n","To the sheen of her nut-brown hair\n","Such a coaxing elf, Id to shake myself\n","To make sure I was standing there.\n","From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay\n","And from Galway to Dublin town\n","No maid Ive seen like the sweet colleen\n","That I met in the County Down.\n","As she onward sped I shook my head\n","And I gazed with a feeling rare\n","And I said, says I, to a passerby\n","Whos the maid with the nut-brown hair?\n","He smiled at me, and with pride says he,\n","Thats the gem of Irelands crown.\n","Shes young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann\n","Shes the star of the County Down.\n","Ive travelled a bit, but never was hit\n","Since my roving career began\n","But fair and square I surrendered there\n","To the charms of young Rose McCann.\n","Id a heart to let and no tenant yet\n","Did I meet with in shawl or gown\n","But in she went and I asked no rent\n","From the star of the County Down.\n","At the crossroads fair Ill be surely there\n","And Ill dress in my Sunday clothes\n","And Ill try sheeps eyes, and deludhering lies\n","On the heart of the nut-brown rose.\n","No pipe Ill smoke, no horse Ill yoke\n","Though with rust my plow turns brown\n","Till a smiling bride by my own fireside\n","Sits the star of the County Down.\n","It was early, early in the spring\n","The birds did whistle and sweetly sing\n","Changing their notes from tree to tree\n","And the song they sang was Old Ireland free.\n","It was early early in the night,\n","The yeoman cavalry gave me a fright\n","The yeoman cavalry was my downfall\n","And I was taken by Lord Cornwall.\n","Twas in the guard-house where I was laid,\n","And in a parlour where I was tried\n","My sentence passed and my courage low\n","When to Dungannon I was forced to go.\n","As I was passing my fathers door\n","My brother William stood at the door\n","My aged father stood at the door\n","And my tender mother her hair she tore.\n","As I was going up Wexford Street\n","My own first cousin I chanced to meet;\n","My own first cousin did me betray\n","And for one bare guinea swore my life away.\n","As I was walking up Wexford Hill\n","Who could blame me to cry my fill?\n","I looked behind, and I looked before\n","But my aged mother I shall see no more.\n","And as I mounted the platform high\n","My aged father was standing by;\n","My aged father did me deny\n","And the name he gave me was the Croppy Boy.\n","It was in Dungannon this young man died\n","And in Dungannon his body lies.\n","And you good people that do pass by\n","Oh shed a tear for the Croppy Boy.\n","One morning early I walked forth\n","By the margin of Lough Leane\n","The sunshine dressed the trees in green\n","And summer bloomed again\n","I left the town and wandered on\n","Through fields all green and gay\n","And whom should I meet but a colleen sweet\n","At the dawning of the day.\n","No cap or cloak this maiden wore\n","Her neck and feet were bare\n","Down to the grass in ringlets fell\n","Her glossy golden hair\n","A milking pail was in her hand\n","She was lovely, young and gay\n","She wore the palm from Venus bright\n","By the dawning of the day.\n","On a mossy bank I sat me down\n","With the maiden by my side\n","With gentle words I courted her\n","And asked her to be my bride\n","She said, Young man dont bring me blame\n","And swiftly turned away\n","And the morning light was shining bright\n","By a lonely prison wall\n","I heard a sweet voice calling,\n","Danny, they have taken you away.\n","For you stole Travelians corn,\n","That your babes might see the morn,\n","Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay.\n","Fair lie the fields of Athenry\n","Where once we watched the small freebirds fly.\n","Our love grew with the spring,\n","We had dreams and songs to sing\n","As we wandered through the fields of Athenry.\n","I heard a young man calling\n","Nothing matters, Jenny, when youre free\n","Against the famine and the crown,\n","I rebelled, they ran me down,\n","Now you must raise our children without me.\n","On the windswept harbour wall,\n","She watched the last star rising\n","As the prison ship sailed out across the sky\n","But shell watch and hope and pray,\n","For her love in Botany Bay\n","Whilst she is lonely in the fields of Athenry.\n","Oh, a wan cloud was drawn oer the dim weeping dawn\n","As to Shannons side I returnd at last\n","And the heart in my breast for the girl I lovd best\n","Was beating, ah, beating, loud and fast!\n","While the doubts and the fears of the long aching years\n","Seemd mingling their voices with the moaning flood\n","Till full in my path, like a wild water wrath\n","My true loves shadow lamenting stood.\n","But the sudden sun kissd the cold, cruel mist\n","Into dancing showrs of diamond dew\n","And the dark flowing stream laughd back to his beam\n","And the lark soared aloft in the blue\n","While no phantom of night but a form of delight\n","Ran with arms outspread to her darling boy\n","And the girl I love best on my wild throbbing breast\n","Hid her thousand treasures with cry of joy.\n","Gather up the pots and the old tin cans\n","The mash, the corn, the barley and the bran.\n","Run like the devil from the excise man\n","Keep the smoke from rising, Barney.\n","Keep your eyes well peeled today\n","The excise men are on their way\n","Searching for the mountain tay\n","In the hills of Connemara.\n","Swinging to the left, swinging to the right\n","The excise men will dance all night\n","Drinkin up the tay till the broad daylight\n","A gallon for the butcher and a quart for John\n","And a bottle for poor old Father Tom\n","Just to help the poor old dear along\n","Stand your ground, for its too late\n","The excise men are at the gate.\n","Glory be to Paddy, but theyre drinkin it straight\n","Im sitting on the stile, Mary, where we once sat side by side\n","On a bright May morning long ago, when first you were my bride\n","The corn was springing fresh and green, and the lark sang loud and high\n","And the red was on your lips, Mary, and the love light in your eyes.\n","Tis but a step down yonder lane, the village Church stands near\n","The place where we were wed, Mary, I can see the spire from here\n","But the graveyard lies between, Mary, and my step might break your rest\n","Where I laid you darling down to sleep with a baby on your breast.\n","Im very lonely now, Mary, for the poor make no new friends\n","But oh they love the better still the few our Father sends\n","For you were all I had, Mary, my blessing and my pride\n","And Ive nothing left to care for now since my poor Mary died.\n","Yours was the good brave heart, Mary, that still kept hoping on\n","When the trust in God had left my soul and my arms young strength had gone\n","There was comfort ever on your lip and a kind look on your brow\n","And I thank you Mary for the same though you cannot hear me now.\n","Im bidding you a long farewell, my Mary kind and true\n","But Ill not forget you, darling, in the land Im going to\n","They say theres bread and work for all, and the sun shines always there\n","But Ill neer forget old Ireland, were it fifty times as fair.\n","And often in those grand old woods Ill sit and shut my eyes\n","And my heart will wander back again to the place where Mary lies\n","And I think Ill see that little stile where we sat side by side\n","In the springing corn and the bright May morn when first you were my bride.\n","When I was at home I was merry and frisky,\n","My dad kept a pig and my mother sold whisky,\n","My uncle was rich, but never would by aisey\n","Till I was enlisted by Corporal Casey.\n","Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey,\n","My dear little Shelah, I thought would run crazy,\n","When I trudged away with tough Corporal Casey.\n","I marched from Kilkenny, and, as I was thinking\n","On Shelah, my heart in my bosom was sinking,\n","But soon I was forced to look fresh as a daisy,\n","For fear of a drubbing from Corporal Casey.\n","Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey!\n","The devil go with him, I neer could be lazy,\n","He struck my shirts so, ould Corporal Casey.\n","We went into battle, I took the blows fairly\n","That fell on my pate, but they bothered me rarely,\n","And who should the first be that dropped, why, and please ye,\n","It was my good friend, honest Corporal Casey.\n","Thinks I you are quiet, and I shall be aisey,\n","So eight years I fought without Corporal Casey.\n","I am a little beggarman, a begging I have been\n","For three score years in this little isle of green\n","Im known along the Liffey from the Basin to the Zoo\n","And everybody calls me by the name of Johnny Dhu.\n","Of all the trades a going, sure the begging is the best\n","For when a man is tired he can sit him down and rest\n","He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do\n","But to slip around the corner with his old rigadoo.\n","I slept in a barn one night in Currabawn\n","A shocking wet night it was, but I slept until the dawn\n","There was holes in the roof and the raindrops coming thru\n","And the rats and the cats were a playing peek a boo.\n","Who did I waken but the woman of the house\n","With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse\n","She began to frighten and I said boo\n","Sure, dont be afraid at all, its only Johnny Dhu.\n","I met a little girl while a walkin out one day\n","Good morrow little flaxen haired girl, I did say\n","Good morrow little beggarman and how do you do\n","With your rags and your tags and your auld rigadoo.\n","Ill buy a pair of leggins and a collar and a tie\n","And a nice young lady Ill go courting by and by\n","Ill buy a pair of goggles and Ill color them with blue\n","And an old fashioned lady I will make her too.\n","So all along the high road with my bag upon my back\n","Over the fields with my bulging heavy sack\n","With holes in my shoes and my toes a peeping thru\n","Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle with my auld rigadoo.\n","O I must be going to bed for its getting late at night\n","The fire is all raked and now tis out of light\n","For now youve heard the story of my auld rigadoo\n","So good and God be with you, from auld Johnny Dhu.\n","Oh, the days of the Kerry dancing\n","Oh, the ring of the pipers tune\n","Oh, for one of those hours of gladness\n","Gone, alas, like our youth, too soon!\n","When the boys began to gather\n","In the glen of a summers night\n","And the Kerry pipers tuning\n","Made us long with wild delight!\n","Oh, to think of it\n","Oh, to dream of it\n","Fills my heart with tears!\n","Was there ever a sweeter Colleen\n","In the dance than Eily More\n","Or a prouder lad than Thady\n","As he boldly took the floor.\n","Lads and lasses to your places\n","Up the middle and down again\n","Ah, the merry hearted laughter\n","Ringing through the happy glen!\n","Time goes on, and the happy years are dead\n","And one by one the merry hearts are fled\n","Silent now is the wild and lonely glen\n","Where the bright glad laugh will echo neer again\n","Only dreaming of days gone by in my heart I hear.\n","Loving voices of old companions\n","Stealing out of the past once more\n","And the sound of the dear old music\n","Soft and sweet as in days of yore.\n","Dear thoughts are in my mind\n","And my soul soars enchanted,\n","As I hear the sweet lark sing\n","In the clear air of the day.\n","For a tender beaming smile\n","To my hope has been granted,\n","And tomorrow she shall hear\n","All my fond heart would say.\n","I shall tell her all my love,\n","All my souls adoration,\n","And I think she will hear\n","And will not say me nay.\n","It is this that gives my soul\n","All its joyous elation,\n","Its cold and raw, the north winds blow\n","Black in the morning early\n","When all the hills were covered with snow\n","Oh then it was winter fairly.\n","As I was riding oer the moor\n","I met a farmers daughter\n","Her cherry cheeks and coal-black hair\n","They caused my heart to falter.\n","I bowed my bonnet very low\n","To let her know my meaning.\n","She answered with a courteous smile\n","Her looks they were engaging.\n","Where are you bound my pretty maid\n","Its now in the morning early?\n","The answer that she gave to me\n","Kind sir, to sell my barley.\n","Now twenty guineas Ive in my purse\n","And twenty more thats yearly.\n","You need not go to the market town\n","For Ill buy all your barley.\n","If twenty guineas would gain the heart\n","Of the maid I love so dearly\n","All for to tarry with me one night\n","And go home in the morning early.\n","The very evening after\n","It was my fortune for to meet\n","The farmers only daughter.\n","Although the weather being cold and raw\n","With her I thought to parlay\n","The answer that she gave to me:\n","Kind sir, Ive sold my barley.\n","The Minstrel Boy to the war is gone\n","In the ranks of death you

at the casement, the form of her true love\n","And he whispers with face bent, Im waiting for you love\n","Get up from the stool, through the lattice step lightly\n","And well rove in the grove while

grandmother\n","Puts her foot on the stool spins the wheel with the other\n","Lazily, easily, now swings the wheel round\n","Slowly and lowly is heard now the reels sound\n","Noiseless and light to the lattice above her\n","The maid steps, then leaps to the arms of her lover.\n","Slower... and slower... and slower the wheel swings\n","Lower... and lower... and lower the reel rings\n","Ere the reel and the wheel stop their ringing and moving\n","Through the grove the young lovers by moonlight are roving.\n","As I roved out one morning\n","Near the verdant braes of Skreen\n","I put my back to the mossy tree\n","To view the dew on the West Countrie\n","The dew on the foreign strand.\n","O sit ye down on the grass, he said\n","On the dewy grass so green\n","For the wee birds all have come and gone\n","Since I my true love seen, he said\n","Since I my true love seen.\n","O Ill not sit on the grass, she said\n","No lover Ill be of thine\n","For I hear you love a Connaught maid\n","And your hearts no longer mine, she said\n","And your hearts no longer mine.\n","O I will climb a high high tree\n","And Ill rob a wild birds nest\n","And back Ill bring what I find there\n","To the arms that I love best, he said\n","To the arms that I love best.\n","The water is wide, I cannot get oer\n","Neither have I wings to fly\n","Give me a boat that can carry two\n","And both shall row, my love and I\n","A ship there is and she sails the sea\n","Shes loaded deep as deep can be\n","But not so deep as the love Im in\n","I know not if I sink or swim\n","I leaned my back against an oak\n","Thinking it was a trusty tree\n","But first it bent and then it broke\n","So did my love prove false to me\n","I reached my finger into some soft bush\n","Thinking the fairest flower to find\n","I pricked my finger to the bone\n","And left the fairest flower behind\n","Oh love be handsome and love be kind\n","Gay as a jewel when first it is new\n","But love grows old and waxes cold\n","And fades away like the morning dew\n","Must I go bound while you go free\n","Must I love a man who doesnt love me\n","Must I be born with so little art\n","As to love a man wholl break my heart\n","When cockle shells turn silver bells\n","Then will my love come back to me\n","When roses bloom in winters gloom\n","Then will my love return to me\n","O Paddy dear, and did ye hear the news

theyre hanging men and women there for the Wearin o the Green.\n","So if the color we must wear be Englands cruel red\n","Let it remind us of the blood that Irishmen have shed\n","And pull the shamrock from your hat, and throw it on the sod\n","But never fear, twill take root there, though underfoot tis trod.\n","When laws can stop the blades of grass from growin as they grow\n","And when

credit, she answered me nay\n","Such a custom as yours I could have any day.\n","I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright\n","And the landladys eyes opened wide with delight.\n","She said I have whiskey and wines of the best\n","And the words that I spoke sure were only in jest.\n","Ill go home to my parents, confess what Ive done\n","And Ill ask them to pardon their prodigal son.\n","And if they caress (forgive) me as ofttimes before\n","Sure I never will play the wild rover no more.\n","Theres a tear in your eye,\n","And Im wondering why,\n","For it never should be there at all.\n","With such powr in your smile,\n","Sure a stone youd beguile,\n","So theres never a teardrop should fall.\n","When your sweet lilting laughters\n","Like some fairy song,\n","And your eyes twinkle bright as can be;\n","You should laugh all the while\n","And all other times smile,\n","And now, smile a smile for me.\n","When Irish eyes are smiling,\n","Sure, tis like the morn in Spring.\n","In the lilt of Irish laughter\n","You can hear the angels sing.\n","When Irish hearts are happy,\n","All the world seems bright and gay.\n","And when Irish eyes are smiling,\n","Sure, they steal your heart away.\n","For your smile is a part\n","Of the love in your heart,\n","And it makes even sunshine more bright.\n","Like the linnets sweet song,\n","Crooning all the day long,\n","Comes your laughter and light.\n","For the springtime of life\n","Is the sweetest of all\n","There is neer a real care or regret;\n","And while springtime is ours\n","Throughout all of youths hours,\n","Let us smile each chance we get.\n","As I was a-goin over Gilgarra Mountain\n","I spied Colonel Farrell, and his money he was countin.\n","First I drew my pistols and then I drew my rapier,\n","Sayin
